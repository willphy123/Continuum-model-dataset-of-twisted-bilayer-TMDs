# Continuum-model-dataset-of-twisted-bilayer-TMDs
This repository contains the dataset to reproduce the continuum model of twisted bilayer MoTe2 and WSe2 as shown in arXiv:2508.17673. 
It contains the machine learning force fields, relaxed moire superlattice at various twist angles, and the twist-angle-dependent Fourier components in the continuum model Hamiltonian.
